This work presents the development of a graphical application in Python for encrypting and decrypting files using classical and modern ciphers. The classical ciphers implemented were Vigenère and Playfair, developed entirely without the use of external libraries, ensuring understanding of their internal mechanisms. The modern ciphers, DES and AES, were implemented using standard cryptographic libraries, ensuring compliance with current security practices. The application allows the user to select encryption or decryption operations, load files containing messages, keys, and tables, and process data in text mode for classical ciphers and in binary mode for modern ciphers. This project aims to consolidate knowledge about symmetric cryptography, addressing both historical concepts and robust contemporary algorithms, and includes considerations on overall system security.
